# FurryCrypt ðŸ¦ŠðŸ’¾

**FurryCrypt** is a fun encryption tool that turns your files into a world of "OwO" and "UwU"! Encrypt your text files with furry-themed encoding and decrypt them with ease.

## Features

- **Furry Encryption:** Turns text into "OwO" and "UwU".
- **Furry Decryption:** Converts back to the original text.
- **Furry File Naming:** Files get cute, furry names.

## How It Works

FurryCrypt converts your text file into binary, then replaces `1`s with "OwO" and `0`s with "UwU". When decrypting, it reverses the process and restores the original text.

### Example

Original text: `ABC`

Encrypted:  
`UwU OwO UwU OwO UwU OwO OwO UwU`

Decrypted: `ABC`

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/havokzero0/FurryCrypt
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```
   cd FurryCrypt
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python furrycrypt.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Encrypt a File:**
   ```
   python furrycrypt.py
   Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt a file? e
   Enter the filename: my_file.txt
   ```

2. **Decrypt a File:**
   ```
   python furrycrypt.py
   Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt a file? d
   Enter the filename: Yiffed_Secrets.furcrypt
   ```

## Furry Naming Convention

Encrypted files get names like:
- `Yiffed_Secrets`
- `PawsOnly`
- `Fursona_Manifest`
- `UwU_Data`
